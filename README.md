## Description
The `MolarMassCalculatorApp` is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the `tkinter` library in Python. It allows users to input a chemical formula and calculates its molar mass by summing the molar masses of the constituent elements based on the given formula. The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters in the chemical formula.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the `molar_mass_calculator.py` file.

2. Make sure you have Python and tkinter module installed on your system.
        To install tkinter:
           in the powershell
   ```bash
         pip install tkinter

4. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `molar_mass_calculator.py` is located.

5. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   chem_python molar_mass_calculator.py
A GUI window will open. Enter a chemical formula in the input field (e.g., H2O, C6H12O6).

Click the "Calculate" button, and the molar mass of the chemical formula will be displayed below the input field.

Dependencies
This program uses the following Python libraries:
